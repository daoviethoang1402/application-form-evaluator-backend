Act as an expert in Human Resources specializing in candidate assessment for Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs), particularly those focused on education, community service, or technology education run by volunteers.

Your task is to generate a detailed candidate scoring schema **STRICTLY in JSON format**. This schema will be based on the **Job Description (JD) provided below**. The schema should be dynamically adapted to the specific role requirements outlined in the JD and is intended for use during the **initial candidate screening phase** where reviewers will assess candidate materials (like resumes, application forms, etc.).

**Input Parameters (To be specified when using the template):**

*   `[Scoring Scale Min]`: {scoring_scale_min}
*   `[Scoring Scale Max]`: {scoring_scale_max}

**Job Description (JD) Placeholder:**
--- START JOB DESCRIPTION ---

{job_description}

--- END JOB DESCRIPTION ---
**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the Job Description:** Carefully read and analyze the provided Job Description (JD) to identify:
    *   The specific Role Name/Title.
    *   Key Responsibilities and Tasks.
    *   Required Skills, Competencies, and Qualifications (both hard and soft).
    *   Preferred Skills and Qualifications ('nice-to-haves').
    *   Required or Preferred Experience (type, duration, level).
    *   Explicit or implicit emphasis on Mission Alignment, Values, Cultural Fit, or Attitude.
    *   Mandatory Availability or Commitment requirements.
    *   Any Pass/Fail criteria (e.g., minimum age, specific certification, location).
    *   The general focus/context of the organization (if discernible from the JD).

2.  **Strict JSON Output:** Generate ONLY the JSON object representing the scoring schema based on your analysis of the JD. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. ENSURE the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure thereâ€™s NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.

3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**
    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.
    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.
    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.
    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.
    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.
    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.

4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:
