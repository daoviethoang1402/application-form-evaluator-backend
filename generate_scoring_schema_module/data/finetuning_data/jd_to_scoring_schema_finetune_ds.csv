Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

The incumbent will live in Hanoi which has most of the economic and social amenities at a reasonable cost. Depending on living arrangements, housing can be expensive. Security is good. Hanoi has a humid, tropical climate and monsoons. Summers, between May and September, are very hot with plenty of rain, while winters, from November to March, are cold and relatively dry. Living conditions in Hanoi are relatively good by developing country standards. There is reasonable availability of goods and services, health facilities, and housing. Security is also reasonably good relative to other developing country large cities. Viet Nam was recently ranked as one of the more secure and stable places to live and do business by outside research groups.\n\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

We work with partners to integrate qualified, highly motivated and well supported UN Volunteers into development programming and promote the value and global recognition of volunteerism. UNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board. Read more about the added value of UNV, UN Volunteers and volunteerism (https://www.unv.org/Added-value-UNV-UN-Volunteers-and-volunteerism).\n\nContext\nUNV works under a dual mandate ‚Äì to mobilize volunteers for the United Nations System and to support to deliver on the 2030 Agenda through the engagement of UN-Volunteers and the integration of volunteerism. UNV Regional Office for Asia Pacific deploys UN Volunteers to around 30 countries and territories every year. In 2021, approximately 1,670 National and International UN Volunteers served with about 30 different UN Entities in the region. As the trends show, the numbers of UN Volunteers, especially National UN Volunteers, in most countries have been increasing due to the COVID-19. UNV puts significant efforts in outreaching to and sourcing future UN Volunteer candidates to help more people join the United Nations system as UN Volunteers and support peace, development and humanitarian efforts around the world.\n\nTask description\nThe expected result of this online volunteering support is to raise awareness on UN Volunteer vacancies and boost applications in Viet Nam. The final product of this online volunteering should present a list of UN Volunteer vacancies re-posted from UNV Asia Pacific regional facebook and twitter; analysis of social media engagement on the shared posts; documentation of good practices of sharing the vacancies and raising awareness on the vacancies; and risk analysis identified while managing the social media posts, etc. Upon selection, the online volunteer will receive further guidance to carry out this online volunteering. The online volunteer will assist over the period of two months in total (from Mar till 30 Apr 2022). Upon completion, the online volunteer will receive a Certificate of Appreciation for his/her contributions.\n\n--- END JOB DESCRIPTION ---\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Job Description:** Carefully read and analyze the provided Job Description (JD) to identify:\n    *   The specific Role Name/Title.\n    *   Key Responsibilities and Tasks.\n    *   Required Skills, Competencies, and Qualifications (both hard and soft).\n    *   Preferred Skills and Qualifications ('nice-to-haves').\n    *   Required or Preferred Experience (type, duration, level).\n    *   Explicit or implicit emphasis on Mission Alignment, Values, Cultural Fit, or Attitude.\n    *   Mandatory Availability or Commitment requirements.\n    *   Any Pass/Fail criteria (e.g., minimum age, specific certification, location).\n    *   The general focus/context of the organization (if discernible from the JD).\n\n2.  **Strict JSON Output:** Generate ONLY the JSON object representing the scoring schema based on your analysis of the JD. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements.

The course aims to raise awareness about sustainable development in our students, shift the mindset of our students, and make a social impact on our community (population: nearly one million people).\n\nTo that end, we are seeking the support of online volunteers to teach 4 topics from the course. The role of the online volunteers is to connect \""their world\"" and \""our students' world\"", as a friendly cultural bridge between those marginalized students with international peers. This will help the students to get international exposure and for the students to think out-of-the-box so they can step out of their comfort zone. The volunteers can also get a better cultural understanding of Vietnam from the students\n\nTask type\nTeaching, Training and Mentorship\n\nTask description\nSpecifically, the selected online volunteers are expected to teach one of 4 topics:\n1. Bussiness Administration and Tourism\n2. Information Technology\n3. Quality Assurance and Research management\n4. English in 17SDGs\n\nThe materials for the course will be provided (MienTrung Industry and Trade College), and the selected online volunteers are expected to also prepare their ideas, experiences, and stories for sharing with the students.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery, a teacher from MienTrung Industry and Trade College will also join the online class to accompany and provide assistance, when needed.\n\nThe class will be held by the Vietnam timezone (UTC +7), on weekdays. Each topic will last 1 session, 2 hours/session. Rather than like a one-way teaching class, these sessions will be more like conversations and discussions where the online volunteers will tell the students about their views, their ideas, and their experiences for students' new perspectives and mindsets. This will also serve as an opportunity for the students to interact and have conversations with colleagues from different backgrounds and get international experience and exposure in education.\n\nA reference letter can be provided, along with scientific research opportunities (if the online volunteers prefer or need to). The volunteers will also be awarded a certificate from UNV at the end of the assignment.\n\nAssignment requirements\nRequired experience\nAt least a Master's degree in topics such as Social and Emotional Learning, Digital Citizen, Liberal Arts Education, or Diversity in Culture with a 17SDG theme.\nPublic speaking experience is a plus.\nAt least 1 year of experience on the topics.\n\nLanguages\nEnglish, Level: Native language, Required\n\nOther information\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

The course aims to raise awareness about sustainable development in our students, shift the mindset of our students, and make a social impact on our community (population: nearly one million people).\n\nTo that end, we are seeking the support of online volunteers to teach 4 topics from the course. The role of the online volunteers is to connect \""their world\"" and \""our students' world\"", as a friendly cultural bridge between those marginalized students with international peers. This will help the students to get international exposure and for the students to think out-of-the-box so they can step out of their comfort zone. The volunteers can also get a better cultural understanding of Vietnam from the students\n\nTask type\nTeaching, Training and Mentorship\n\nTask description\nSpecifically, the selected online volunteers are expected to teach one of 4 topics:\n1. Bussiness Administration and Tourism\n2. Information Technology\n3. Quality Assurance and Research management\n4. English in 17SDGs\n\nThe materials for the course will be provided (MienTrung Industry and Trade College), and the selected online volunteers are expected to also prepare their ideas, experiences, and stories for sharing with the students.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery, a teacher from MienTrung Industry and Trade College will also join the online class to accompany and provide assistance, when needed.\n\nThe class will be held by the Vietnam timezone (UTC +7), on weekdays. Each topic will last 1 session, 2 hours/session. Rather than like a one-way teaching class, these sessions will be more like conversations and discussions where the online volunteers will tell the students about their views, their ideas, and their experiences for students' new perspectives and mindsets. This will also serve as an opportunity for the students to interact and have conversations with colleagues from different backgrounds and get international experience and exposure in education.\n\nA reference letter can be provided, along with scientific research opportunities (if the online volunteers prefer or need to). The volunteers will also be awarded a certificate from UNV at the end of the assignment.\n\nAssignment requirements\nRequired experience\nAt least a Master's degree in topics such as Social and Emotional Learning, Digital Citizen, Liberal Arts Education, or Diversity in Culture with a 17SDG theme.\nPublic speaking experience is a plus.\nAt least 1 year of experience on the topics.\n\nLanguages\nEnglish, Level: Native language, Required\n\nOther information\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

We work with partners to integrate qualified, highly motivated and well supported UN Volunteers into development programming and promote the value and global recognition of volunteerism. UNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board. Read more about the added value of UNV, UN Volunteers and volunteerism (https://www.unv.org/Added-value-UNV-UN-Volunteers-and-volunteerism).\n\nContext\nUNV works under a dual mandate ‚Äì to mobilize volunteers for the United Nations System and to support to deliver on the 2030 Agenda through the engagement of UN-Volunteers and the integration of volunteerism. UNV Regional Office for Asia Pacific deploys UN Volunteers to around 30 countries and territories every year. In 2021, approximately 1,670 National and International UN Volunteers served with about 30 different UN Entities in the region. As the trends show, the numbers of UN Volunteers, especially National UN Volunteers, in most countries have been increasing due to the COVID-19. UNV puts significant efforts in outreaching to and sourcing future UN Volunteer candidates to help more people join the United Nations system as UN Volunteers and support peace, development and humanitarian efforts around the world.\n\nTask description\nThe expected result of this online volunteering support is to raise awareness on UN Volunteer vacancies and boost applications in Viet Nam. The final product of this online volunteering should present a list of UN Volunteer vacancies re-posted from UNV Asia Pacific regional facebook and twitter; analysis of social media engagement on the shared posts; documentation of good practices of sharing the vacancies and raising awareness on the vacancies; and risk analysis identified while managing the social media posts, etc. Upon selection, the online volunteer will receive further guidance to carry out this online volunteering. The online volunteer will assist over the period of two months in total (from Mar till 30 Apr 2022). Upon completion, the online volunteer will receive a Certificate of Appreciation for his/her contributions.\n\n--- END JOB DESCRIPTION ---\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Job Description:** Carefully read and analyze the provided Job Description (JD) to identify:\n    *   The specific Role Name/Title.\n    *   Key Responsibilities and Tasks.\n    *   Required Skills, Competencies, and Qualifications (both hard and soft).\n    *   Preferred Skills and Qualifications ('nice-to-haves').\n    *   Required or Preferred Experience (type, duration, level).\n    *   Explicit or implicit emphasis on Mission Alignment, Values, Cultural Fit, or Attitude.\n    *   Mandatory Availability or Commitment requirements.\n    *   Any Pass/Fail criteria (e.g., minimum age, specific certification, location).\n    *   The general focus/context of the organization (if discernible from the JD).\n\n2.  **Strict JSON Output:** Generate ONLY the JSON object representing the scoring schema based on your analysis of the JD. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

We work with partners to integrate qualified, highly motivated and well supported UN Volunteers into development programming and promote the value and global recognition of volunteerism. UNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board. Read more about the added value of UNV, UN Volunteers and volunteerism (https://www.unv.org/Added-value-UNV-UN-Volunteers-and-volunteerism).\n\nContext\nUNV works under a dual mandate ‚Äì to mobilize volunteers for the United Nations System and to support to deliver on the 2030 Agenda through the engagement of UN-Volunteers and the integration of volunteerism. UNV Regional Office for Asia Pacific deploys UN Volunteers to around 30 countries and territories every year. In 2021, approximately 1,670 National and International UN Volunteers served with about 30 different UN Entities in the region. As the trends show, the numbers of UN Volunteers, especially National UN Volunteers, in most countries have been increasing due to the COVID-19. UNV puts significant efforts in outreaching to and sourcing future UN Volunteer candidates to help more people join the United Nations system as UN Volunteers and support peace, development and humanitarian efforts around the world.\n\nTask description\nThe expected result of this online volunteering support is to raise awareness on UN Volunteer vacancies and boost applications in Viet Nam. The final product of this online volunteering should present a list of UN Volunteer vacancies re-posted from UNV Asia Pacific regional facebook and twitter; analysis of social media engagement on the shared posts; documentation of good practices of sharing the vacancies and raising awareness on the vacancies; and risk analysis identified while managing the social media posts, etc. Upon selection, the online volunteer will receive further guidance to carry out this online volunteering. The online volunteer will assist over the period of two months in total (from Mar till 30 Apr 2022). Upon completion, the online volunteer will receive a Certificate of Appreciation for his/her contributions.\n\n--- END JOB DESCRIPTION ---\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Job Description:** Carefully read and analyze the provided Job Description (JD) to identify:\n    *   The specific Role Name/Title.\n    *   Key Responsibilities and Tasks.\n    *   Required Skills, Competencies, and Qualifications (both hard and soft).\n    *   Preferred Skills and Qualifications ('nice-to-haves').\n    *   Required or Preferred Experience (type, duration, level).\n    *   Explicit or implicit emphasis on Mission Alignment, Values, Cultural Fit, or Attitude.\n    *   Mandatory Availability or Commitment requirements.\n    *   Any Pass/Fail criteria (e.g., minimum age, specific certification, location).\n    *   The general focus/context of the organization (if discernible from the JD).\n\n2.  **Strict JSON Output:** Generate ONLY the JSON object representing the scoring schema based on your analysis of the JD. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

The course aims to raise awareness about sustainable development in our students, shift the mindset of our students, and make a social impact on our community (population: nearly one million people).\n\nTo that end, we are seeking the support of online volunteers to teach 4 topics from the course. The role of the online volunteers is to connect \""their world\"" and \""our students' world\"", as a friendly cultural bridge between those marginalized students with international peers. This will help the students to get international exposure and for the students to think out-of-the-box so they can step out of their comfort zone. The volunteers can also get a better cultural understanding of Vietnam from the students\n\nTask type\nTeaching, Training and Mentorship\n\nTask description\nSpecifically, the selected online volunteers are expected to teach one of 4 topics:\n1. Bussiness Administration and Tourism\n2. Information Technology\n3. Quality Assurance and Research management\n4. English in 17SDGs\n\nThe materials for the course will be provided (MienTrung Industry and Trade College), and the selected online volunteers are expected to also prepare their ideas, experiences, and stories for sharing with the students.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery, a teacher from MienTrung Industry and Trade College will also join the online class to accompany and provide assistance, when needed.\n\nThe class will be held by the Vietnam timezone (UTC +7), on weekdays. Each topic will last 1 session, 2 hours/session. Rather than like a one-way teaching class, these sessions will be more like conversations and discussions where the online volunteers will tell the students about their views, their ideas, and their experiences for students' new perspectives and mindsets. This will also serve as an opportunity for the students to interact and have conversations with colleagues from different backgrounds and get international experience and exposure in education.\n\nA reference letter can be provided, along with scientific research opportunities (if the online volunteers prefer or need to). The volunteers will also be awarded a certificate from UNV at the end of the assignment.\n\nAssignment requirements\nRequired experience\nAt least a Master's degree in topics such as Social and Emotional Learning, Digital Citizen, Liberal Arts Education, or Diversity in Culture with a 17SDG theme.\nPublic speaking experience is a plus.\nAt least 1 year of experience on the topics.\n\nLanguages\nEnglish, Level: Native language, Required\n\nOther information\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

The course aims to raise awareness about sustainable development in our students, shift the mindset of our students, and make a social impact on our community (population: nearly one million people).\n\nTo that end, we are seeking the support of online volunteers to teach 4 topics from the course. The role of the online volunteers is to connect \""their world\"" and \""our students' world\"", as a friendly cultural bridge between those marginalized students with international peers. This will help the students to get international exposure and for the students to think out-of-the-box so they can step out of their comfort zone. The volunteers can also get a better cultural understanding of Vietnam from the students\n\nTask type\nTeaching, Training and Mentorship\n\nTask description\nSpecifically, the selected online volunteers are expected to teach one of 4 topics:\n1. Bussiness Administration and Tourism\n2. Information Technology\n3. Quality Assurance and Research management\n4. English in 17SDGs\n\nThe materials for the course will be provided (MienTrung Industry and Trade College), and the selected online volunteers are expected to also prepare their ideas, experiences, and stories for sharing with the students.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery, a teacher from MienTrung Industry and Trade College will also join the online class to accompany and provide assistance, when needed.\n\nThe class will be held by the Vietnam timezone (UTC +7), on weekdays. Each topic will last 1 session, 2 hours/session. Rather than like a one-way teaching class, these sessions will be more like conversations and discussions where the online volunteers will tell the students about their views, their ideas, and their experiences for students' new perspectives and mindsets. This will also serve as an opportunity for the students to interact and have conversations with colleagues from different backgrounds and get international experience and exposure in education.\n\nA reference letter can be provided, along with scientific research opportunities (if the online volunteers prefer or need to). The volunteers will also be awarded a certificate from UNV at the end of the assignment.\n\nAssignment requirements\nRequired experience\nAt least a Master's degree in topics such as Social and Emotional Learning, Digital Citizen, Liberal Arts Education, or Diversity in Culture with a 17SDG theme.\nPublic speaking experience is a plus.\nAt least 1 year of experience on the topics.\n\nLanguages\nEnglish, Level: Native language, Required\n\nOther information\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

Its current path of development is guided by the Socio-Economic Development Strategy from 2021-2025, which sets the country on a course to become a developing country with modern industry overcoming the lower-middle income status by 2025. The incumbent will live in Hanoi which has most of the economic and social amenities at a reasonable cost. Depending on living arrangements, housing can be expensive. Security is good. Hanoi has a humid, tropical climate and monsoons. Summers, between May and September, are very hot with plenty of rain, while winters, from November to March, are cold and relatively dry. Living conditions in Hanoi are relatively good by developing country standards. There is reasonable availability of goods and services, health facilities, and housing. Security is also reasonably good relative to other developing country large cities. Viet Nam was recently ranked as one of the more secure and stable places to live and do business by outside research groups.\n\nInclusivity statement\nUnited Nations Volunteers is an equal opportunity programme that welcomes applications from qualified professionals.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Read more about the added value of UNV, UN Volunteers and volunteerism (https://www.unv.org/Added-value-UNV-UN-Volunteers-and-volunteerism).\n\nContext\nUNV works under a dual mandate ‚Äì to mobilize volunteers for the United Nations System and to support to deliver on the 2030 Agenda through the engagement of UN-Volunteers and the integration of volunteerism. UNV Regional Office for Asia Pacific deploys UN Volunteers to around 30 countries and territories every year. In 2021, approximately 1,670 National and International UN Volunteers served with about 30 different UN Entities in the region. As the trends show, the numbers of UN Volunteers, especially National UN Volunteers, in most countries have been increasing due to the COVID-19. UNV puts significant efforts in outreaching to and sourcing future UN Volunteer candidates to help more people join the United Nations system as UN Volunteers and support peace, development and humanitarian efforts around the world.\n\nTask description\nThe expected result of this online volunteering support is to raise awareness on UN Volunteer vacancies and boost applications in Viet Nam. The final product of this online volunteering should present a list of UN Volunteer vacancies re-posted from UNV Asia Pacific regional facebook and twitter; analysis of social media engagement on the shared posts; documentation of good practices of sharing the vacancies and raising awareness on the vacancies; and risk analysis identified while managing the social media posts, etc. Upon selection, the online volunteer will receive further guidance to carry out this online volunteering. The online volunteer will assist over the period of two months in total (from Mar till 30 Apr 2022). Upon completion, the online volunteer will receive a Certificate of Appreciation for his/her contributions.\n\n--- END JOB DESCRIPTION ---\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Job Description:** Carefully read and analyze the provided Job Description (JD) to identify:\n    *   The specific Role Name/Title.\n    *   Key Responsibilities and Tasks.\n    *   Required Skills, Competencies, and Qualifications (both hard and soft).\n    *   Preferred Skills and Qualifications ('nice-to-haves').\n    *   Required or Preferred Experience (type, duration, level).\n    *   Explicit or implicit emphasis on Mission Alignment, Values, Cultural Fit, or Attitude.\n    *   Mandatory Availability or Commitment requirements.\n    *   Any Pass/Fail criteria (e.g., minimum age, specific certification, location).\n    *   The general focus/context of the organization (if discernible from the JD).\n\n2.  **Strict JSON Output:** Generate ONLY the JSON object representing the scoring schema based on your analysis of the JD. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON. JSON MUST be comment-free. Ensure there‚Äôs NO trailing comma after the last item in the scoringCategories array or any other array/object.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.

Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure itself. Ensure the output is valid JSON.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Adaptation (Based on JD Analysis):**\n    *   **Weights:** Adapt the `weight_percent` for each scoring category based on the emphasis found in the JD.\n    *   **Criteria:** Populate the `criteria` array within each category with specific sub-criteria *derived directly* from the JD's listed responsibilities, skills, and requirements. Name criteria clearly based on the JD content.\n    *   **Scoring Anchors:** Populate the `scoring_anchors` for each criterion using the specified `[Scoring Scale Min]` and `[Scoring Scale Max]`. The descriptions for each score level should reflect how well a candidate meets the specific criterion *as described or implied in the JD*, providing guidance for a reviewer assessing actual candidate materials later.\n    *   **Assessment Description:** For each criterion, provide a concise `assessment_description` explaining *what aspect* related to the JD requirement the reviewer should evaluate when looking at candidate materials later.\n    *   **Metadata:** Populate `roleName` and `organizationFocus` (if discernible) in the `schemaMetadata` based on the JD.\n    *   **Pass/Fail:** Populate the `passFailThresholds` array with any non-negotiable minimum requirements identified in the JD analysis.\n\n4.  **JSON Structure:** Adhere precisely to the following JSON structure, filling in the placeholders and dynamic content based on your JD analysis:\n\n    {\n      \""schemaMetadata\"": {\n        \""roleName\"": \""[Derived Role Name from JD]\"",\n        \""organizationFocus\"": \""[Derived Org Focus or General NPO]\"",\n        // HARDCODED VALUE FOR THIS PROMPT'S SCOPE:\n        \""screeningPhase\"": \""Initial Candidate Screening\"",\n        \""scoringScale\"": {\n          \""min\"": [Populated Min Value],\n          \""max\"": [Populated Max Value]\n        },\n        \""version\"": \""1.0\"",\n        \""description\"": \""Scoring schema derived from Job Description for initial candidate assessment.
