Context
The Global Citizenship course is an online social impact course that is free and mandatory for our students. The course aims to raise awareness about sustainable development in our students, shift the mindset of our students, and make a social impact on our community (population: nearly one million people).

To that end, we are seeking the support of online volunteers to teach 4 topics from the course. The role of the online volunteers is to connect "their world" and "our students' world", as a friendly cultural bridge between those marginalized students with international peers. This will help the students to get international exposure and for the students to think out-of-the-box so they can step out of their comfort zone. The volunteers can also get a better cultural understanding of Vietnam from the students

Task type
Teaching, Training and Mentorship

Task description
Specifically, the selected online volunteers are expected to teach one of 4 topics:
1. Bussiness Administration and Tourism
2. Information Technology
3. Quality Assurance and Research management
4. English in 17SDGs

The materials for the course will be provided (MienTrung Industry and Trade College), and the selected online volunteers are expected to also prepare their ideas, experiences, and stories for sharing with the students.

To ensure smooth delivery, a teacher from MienTrung Industry and Trade College will also join the online class to accompany and provide assistance, when needed.

The class will be held by the Vietnam timezone (UTC +7), on weekdays. Each topic will last 1 session, 2 hours/session. Rather than like a one-way teaching class, these sessions will be more like conversations and discussions where the online volunteers will tell the students about their views, their ideas, and their experiences for students' new perspectives and mindsets. This will also serve as an opportunity for the students to interact and have conversations with colleagues from different backgrounds and get international experience and exposure in education.

A reference letter can be provided, along with scientific research opportunities (if the online volunteers prefer or need to). The volunteers will also be awarded a certificate from UNV at the end of the assignment.

At least a Master's degree in topics such as Social and Emotional Learning, Digital Citizen, Liberal Arts Education, or Diversity in Culture with a 17SDG theme.
Public speaking experience is a plus.
At least 1 year of experience on the topics.
